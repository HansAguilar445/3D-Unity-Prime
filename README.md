# 3D-Unity-Prime
This was my attempt at replicating what I've seen of Metroid Prime, using assets from the Models Resource. I made this in 2020 or 2021 as a project for something in class. All things considered, it turned out decently. Unfortunately, time has taken its toll and some of the files have disappeared. There used to be a version with controller compatibility, but only the one with exclusively keyboard compatibility remains.
